# Path: A student platform

The goal of this project is to provide students with a distraction free platform, that boosts motivation and discipline.
It makes studying fun and shifts it into a more meaningful perspective. It will cost nothing and all platforms should be supported.
**Learners form a community and strive together. It should be essential to everyone, who wants to get into the habit of studying.**
